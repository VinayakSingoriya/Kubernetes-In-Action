# Service: ExternalName
An ExternalName Service in Kubernetes is useful when you have a service that is running outside your Kubernetes cluster, such as a database, and you want to access it from within your cluster.

For example, let's say you have an app in a Pod that needs to access an external database running at the domain name "db-prod.example.com". For this database, you can create an ExternalName Service named, say, "db-prod". Then, when the app wants to connect to the database, it will send a request to the local name "db-prod". Next, Kubernetes will look up the ExternalName Service for "db-prod" and see that it has an external name of "db-prod.example.com". Kubernetes will then use DNS to resolve the external name to an IP address and route the request to the appropriate external service outside the Kubernetes cluster. This process happens automatically and seamlessly. The app doesnâ€™t need to be aware of the details of the external service.

## Benefits of ExternalName Service
- It helps you keep the details of your external service separate from your application.

- Instead of hard-coding IP addresses or domain names, you can give these services a nickname using an ExternalName Service. If the service provider moves to a new IP address or gets a new domain name, you can simply update the ExternalName Service definition to point to the new location. Kubernetes will handle the DNS resolution of the new address so that the application can continue to access the external service using the same local name. No modifications are required in the application code. This makes managing your external services much easier as you don't have to update the application code each time the external service changes.


**Note**: ExternalName Service does not have a selector, as it does not map to any Pods.
